# Aaron Swartz Tribute
A tribute to Aaron Swartz featuring a biographical timeline using Knightlab's TimelineJS3 plugin.

This is my first Front End Development project for Free Code Camp. It's a tribute page to Aaron Swartz, a fallen champion for a free and open internet who was unjustly targeted by the US government but wouldn't back down. After years of standing his ground, the fight took its toll and the world lost a rare and brilliant soul.
